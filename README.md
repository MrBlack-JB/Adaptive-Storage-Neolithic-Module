Q: Is this compatible with LWM Deep Storage?  
A: Yes! LWM is compatible and will not interfere with any of our features, in fact, the two compliment each other. Additionally, there are mod settings in ASF for you to choose between some systems.  
  
Q: Is this compatible with [insert storage mod here]?  
A: ASF only adds extra functionalities to be used, it doesn’t alter already existing features by itself, therefore it should be compatible with most mods out there.  
  
Q: How performance friendly is this mod?  
A: Very. We made sure to make the framework as performance friendly as possible so it shouldn’t affect your gameplay.  
  
Q: Do you accept suggestions?  
A: Yes! If you have a well thought out idea, please comment it down below and let us know what you think the mod is missing.  
  
Q: Why only neolithic tech?  
A: Each module only covers one tech level, then released as its own module, otherwise it would have taken us a lot of time to publish anything of note. We are hoping to kickstart the series with the first module.  
  
Q: What about mod compatibility integration?  
A: WIP. Stay tuned.
